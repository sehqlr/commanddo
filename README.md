# commanddo
## a small program that takes a YAML file and turns it into a bash script

The idea here is that you pass a YAML file to `commanddo` and it transforms
it into a bash script, then executes it on the same machine. This could be used
for a simple ad-hoc command system in a cluster of microservices, or something
similar
